## Core Features:

- Initial Test Generation: Initial Test Generation: Use the LLM to create initial unit tests from the C++ source code and YAML instructions.
- Test Refinement: Test Refinement Tool: Use the LLM to recognize and remove duplicate tests, add necessary libraries, and refine the test quality based on feedback and YAML configuration.
- Build Issue Solver: Build Issue Resolution: Use the LLM as a tool to analyze build logs, identify errors, and propose fixes based on YAML guidelines for automated debugging.
- Coverage Optimizer: Test Coverage Improvement: Leverage the LLM to interpret code coverage reports, identify gaps, and suggest improvements with proper formatting based on a provided YAML file.
- Coverage Display: Result Presentation: Display the test results and the current test coverage
- Automated Test Execution: Automated Test Execution: Automatically executes the generated tests with a C++ testing framework and provides reports.
